## 🔍 Project Overview
The Student Management System (SMS) is a full-stack application designed to simplify and automate key academic workflows in educational institutions. It provides separate, user-friendly dashboards for Admins and Students, enabling efficient management of student information, attendance, tasks, announcements, and performance-related activities.

The system follows a modular architecture with a Spring Boot backend exposing RESTful APIs and a lightweight HTML/JS frontend (easily upgradable to Angular/React). The backend uses MySQL for secure and structured data storage and supports CRUD operations through a clean service-repository pattern.

Through this platform, admins can add, update, or remove students, publish announcements, assign tasks, and monitor attendance. Students can view their personal dashboard, access tasks and announcements, check attendance, and update their profiles. The solution is built to be scalable, extensible, and deployment-ready, with Docker support included for containerized environments.

This project demonstrates hands-on skills in Java, Spring Boot, REST API design, database integration, and frontend development, while also providing a template suitable for real-world institutional use.
